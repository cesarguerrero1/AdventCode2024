## Summary 
This repository contains all of the code for each day of the Advent of Code 2024 challenge. I want to keep my C++ skills sharp so all solutions will be done in C++.

To speed up compilation I will be using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 

## Details
I want to keep a journal of each day so this section will provide an explanation of my solution as well as any comments about the problem itself.
